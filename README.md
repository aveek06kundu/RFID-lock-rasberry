# RFID-lock-rasberry
This method opens the Raspberry Piâ€™s serial port, and loops continuously to read a RFID card/tag. It is the primary method of the Pi-Lock, and starts when the RPi boots up. If a card is found, it calls the findTag() function, which in turn searches in the local SQLite database (table: seguridad_permisos) for the card, and then determines if the scanned card if valid for entry.
