Pi-Lock employs the use of a few object-oriented classes to make the source code more efficient, legible, and comprehensible. The classes are broken up into the following files:

EntryLog
Logs an entry in local SQLite db, and post data in JSON format to server
ErrorLog
Logs an error in local SQLite db
Permission
With the scanned RFID tag #, looks into local SQLite db for the matching information, and sets object’s instance variables to the record found, else to None
SystemStats
Records and saves the RPi’s CPU temperature, and RAM, CPU and SD-card usage in JSON format
